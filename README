Contributing

  I welcome contributions from the public. The issue tracker is
  the preferred channel for bug reports and feature requests. 
  The bug tracker utilises several labels to help organise and 
  identify issues. Whenever submitting a new issue, please use 
  the GitHub issue search first — check if the issue has already 
  been reported.

  Make sure to run https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck when you 
  are done editing or create a shell script. This will help 
  maintain clean and uniform code throughout the project.

  If you would like to submit a patch via email, that is fine too.
  Just run the following command and send the patch to contact
